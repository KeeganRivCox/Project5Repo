Now that the customer has sent hate mail to the seller, the seller has blocked them and the customer cannot send new messages to them, though he can view the previous conversation history. The seller then becomes invisible to the customer, meaning that when the customer clicks the back button, the seller's store no longer appears in the list of stores the customer can see.
